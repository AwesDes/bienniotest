= Rumors in the <span style="color: #800000">**Comintern**</span>

Our delegates within the <span style="color: #800000">**Comintern**</span> have reported suspicious activity by the <span style="color: #bf0000">**Soviet**</span> representatives, many replaced with seemingly more loyal delegates to Stalin, as well as sentiments of a centralisation of the organisation towards one nation. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has also reported any trade with the <span style="color: #bf0000">**Soviets**</span> has been **suspended**, citing various excuses.

This is of grave concern to us, and it is recommended we begin attempting to sway the uncommitted delegates to our side, lest the <span style="color: #bf0000">**Soviet Union**</span> attempts anything rash.

A New World Congress is scheduled **one year** from now.
