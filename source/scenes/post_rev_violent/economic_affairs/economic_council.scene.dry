= The Economic Plan

The party is split on the new direction of the <span style="color: #BF0000">**Soviet**</span> economy. Expectedly, two distinct factions have emerged from endless debates and arguments, that being the Orthodox Marxists, and the Pragmatists.

The Orthodox Marxists, for the most part, support **Central Economic Planning**, allowing for full governmental control of the economy, its expertise and efficiency allowing for necessary resources to be allocated for optimal economic growth and recovery.
 
On the other hand, the Pragmatists support Lenin's *New Economic Policy*, advocating for an equivalent policy for <span style="color: #009246">**Italy**</span>, arguing for its necessity after our Civil War and to stimulate economic growth.

Though there are naturally other arguments for economic policy, such as a mix of both the NEP and Central Planning, it is likely that either plan will be chosen upon the next <span style="color: #BF0000">**Congress of Soviets**</span>.

- @support_gosplan: Support the Orthodox Marxists.
- @support_nep: Support the Pragmatists.
- @force_vote: Force a vote on the two policies.

subtitle: This will invoke the ire of the right.
on-arrival: left_eco_support += 1; turatian_dissent += 4; gradualist_dissent += 7; syndicalist_dissent += 3; labour_dissent += 5;

We throw our weight behind the Orthodox Marxists, agreeing that only a centrally planned economy will allow us to recover, much to the chagrin of the Pragmatists. They argue that such a policies will only inflict suffering and replicate the failures of *War Communism* in <span style="color: #bf0000">**Russia**</span> once more.

@support_nep
subtitle: This will invoke the ire of the left.
on-arrival: right_eco_support += 1; bordigist_dissent += 4; ordinovist_dissent += 7; syndicalist_dissent += 3; maximalist_dissent += 2;

We throw our weight behind the Pragmatists, agreeing that relaxing the total nationalisation of industry is necessary, at least temporary, in order to foster economic growth and production. Nevertheless, opponents argue that the plan represents a step back towards capitalism, calling it a betrayal of the revolution and communism.

@force_vote
view-if: left_eco_support >= 2 or right_eco_support >= 2

We force a vote on the two policies in the <span style="color: #BF0000">**Congress of Soviets**</span>, as both a proposal for a Centrally Planned Economy, as well as a *New Economic Policy*-esque proposal are introduced.

With a simple majority in the <span style="color: #BF0000">**Congress of Soviets**</span>, the Proposal on the Central Economic Plan passes! Murmurs of grumbling does come from the Pragmatists, but a majority is hard to dispute.

Nevertheless, there is much work to be done.

@adopt_none
view-if: right_eco_yes < 50 and left_eco_yes < 50

Neither proposals are able to achieve a majority in the <span style="color: #BF0000">**Congress of Soviets**</span>. Thus, the responsibility falls to the Chairman of the Central Executive Committee, though the failure of both proposals means the supporters of the policy not chosen will be upset at our choice.

[? if left_eco_yes + right_eco_yes < 50 : However, the failures of both proposals to reach even a combined vote of 50% has prompted the emergence of a new faction, proposing the merger of the two policies for each region. The new proposal would implement the policies of a Centrally Planned Economy within the Northern, more industrialised regions, while allowing for a more relaxed NEP-esque policy within the Southern Agricultural regions. ?]

[? if left_eco_yes + right_eco_yes < 50 : To call the proposal a bureaucratic nightmare would be an understatement. The proposal would essential mean the existence of two economies right beside one another, with the responsibilities of trade, pricing and complains assumed by the state, alongside the management of the two economies themselves. Nevertheless, it would provide the best of both worlds, and encourage a boom if managed successfully. ?]

- @choose_central: Adopt the Central Economic Plan.
- @choose_nep: Adopt the New Economic Policy.
- @choose_both: Adopt the 'Regional Dualism' system.

Eventually, the Central Economic Plan is adopted by order of Chairman [+ premier +]. Reactions of outrage from the Pragmatists naturally occur, who demand a revote instead. 

Nevertheless, amongst some protests, we must act. There is much work to be done.

on-arrival: both_eco_adopted = 1; economic_plan = 1; bordigist_dissent += 4; ordinovist_dissent += 4; gradualist_dissent += 4; turatian_dissent += 4; 

Rather than the two proposals, the new proposed system of 'Regional Dualism' is selected instead, with specifics to be drafted up in the future. Though attempting to appease both sides, murmurs of grumbling have been heard from both sides, albeit more muted than if we had solely chosen a side.

There is significant work to be done, staffers informed, plans drafted and people to be hired. It is imperative the success of the plan is shown swiftly, yet implemented fully to quell dissenting voices.
