= Timeline of the [+ psi_name +] and the Kingdom (until 1919)

**1861**: The Kingdom of Italy is officially unified and established as a nation-state under a Constitutional Monarch.

**1892**: The [+ psi_name +] is officially founded in Genoa, caused by the rise of labour, socialism and dissatisfaction with the political system. It is divided between the Reformists & Revolutionaries, growing throughout the rest of the Century into a coalition of Communists to Social Democrats.

**1898**: Protests are violently suppressed by the Italian government, leading to political radicalisation of the working class and an increase in [+ psi_name +] popularity.

**1900**: King Umberto I is assassinated by an anarchist, further heightening tensions.

**1914**: World War One begins. Parties are divided on the Italian stance towards the war, though the [+ psi_name +] adopts a neutrality stance against the war and opposes any intervention in the conflict.

**1915**: Italy joins World War One on the side of the Entente after signing the Treaty of London. The [+ psi_name +] fractures as more radical members support the war whilst others remained anti-war, resulting in members like Benito Mussolini being kicked out of the party.

**1917**: Increased war exhaustion and discontent increases the [+ psi_name +]'s popularity, as many become frustrated with Italy's involvement in World War One.

**1919**: World War One ends.

**[+ rev_year +]** - The Kingdom of Italy is violently overthrown by left-wing forces that establish a Italian Soviet republic.
