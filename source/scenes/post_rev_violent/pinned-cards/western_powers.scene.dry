= The <span style="color: #046276">**Western Powers**</span>

Battered, exhausted, weakened. The <span style="color: #046276">**Western Powers**</span>. The <span style="color: #00247D">**United**</span> <span style="color: #CF142B">**Kingdom**</span> and the <span style="color: #39AAAA">**French Republic**</span>, nearly a decade after the guns of war fell silent in 1918, stand still deeply haunted by its echos.

<span style="color: #39AAAA">**France**</span> continues its pursuit of financial reparations, continuing its enmity against the <span style="color: #000000">**Ge**</span><span style="color: #DD0000">**rm**</span><span style="color: #FFCC00">**an**</span> Republic. 

The <span style="color: #00247D">**United**</span> <span style="color: #CF142B">**Kingdom**</span> has entered financial ruin; Inflation, Debts, Currency Devaluation has brought the nation to its knees, alongside the slow slip of imperialism. <span style="color: #009A44>**Irish**</span> independence. The growing desires of the Canada and Australia. Even at home, Labour has achieved victory for the first time since its founding.

Yet, to call these nations weak, to call them sympathetic to us would be a grave mistake. The <span style="color: #046276">**Western Powers**</span> still remain the greatest powers in Europe, if not the world. Thus, though unwillingly, we must extend diplomatic overtures, as <span style="color: #bf0000">**Russia**</span> did, to ensure the horrors and scenes of war inflicted on our people shall not repeat a third, if not final, time.

Our relations with the <span style="color: #00247D">**United**</span> <span style="color: #CF142B">**Kingdom**</span> have always been rocky, from their betrayal following the Treaty of London to our revolution. Nevertheless, <span style="color: #00247D">**Bri**</span><span style="color: #CF142B">**tain**</span> remains a necessary trading partner in the world, and reassurances would go a long way in repairing relations to cordial terms, at the very least.

Our revolution has brought great concern to the <span style="color: #39AAAA">**Republic**</span>, now sharing a border with a <span style="color: #BF0000">**Soviet Republic**</span>. Regardless, we can reassure the <span style="color: #39AAAA">**Republic**</span> that we have no intention of coming into conflict, nor dragging the nation back into a global conflict mere years after its first.

Capital Flight has left the nation in...desperate need for funds. With the *New Economic Policy*, our efforts to return foreign investments back to the nation have redoubled, hopefully aiding our economic and social recovery.

Foreign Market Access has been limited following the Civil War, with only members of the <span style="color: #800000">**International**</span> opening their arms to trade. Through negotiations, however, we have achieved a trade deal to open markets with the <span style="color: #046276">**Western Powers**</span>! 

This will aid in exporting our goods and importing crops we might need massively.

Even prior to the war, a significant portion of our domestic food consumption had to be imported, not to mention after the revolution. Hopefully, importing foods from foreign market will have alleviate social inequality plaguing the nation.
