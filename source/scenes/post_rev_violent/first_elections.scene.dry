go-to: decisions

With a plurality of votes, Amadeo Bordiga is elected Chairman of the Committee, having garnered the votes of Bordigists and reluctant Ordinovists. The factional difference between the Secretary-General and Chairman is concerning.

Bordiga's ascension to power represents a significant ideological shift leftwards for the party, as well as harsher crackdowns on reactionaries and non-communists within the nation. Bordiga's divisive rhetoric against Filippo Turati and his supporters do nothing to aid factional unity within the party, as well.

With a plurality of votes, Giacomo Menotti Serrati is elected Chairman of the Committee, having garnered the votes of Maximalists, Social Patriots and some of the more radical Unionists.

Serrati's ascension to power represents the continuation of the ideological balance between two opposing ends of the left-wing spectrum, excaberated by the success of the revolution. It is unclear whether Serrati will be able to keep the party in tact, or keep the Maximalists in charge to restore order.

go-to: decisions

With a plurality of votes, Filippo Turati is elected Chairman of the Committee, having garnered the votes of Turatians, Gradualists and the moderate Unionists. The factional difference between the Secretary-General and Chairman is concerning.

Turati's ascension to power represents a significant ideological shift towards the right, as it is likely Turati will seek to forge pragmatic alliances outside the party in an effort to stabilise the nation.

Following the end of the Civil War, the Red Guards, now fielding [+ rg_strength +] thousand men alongside forces within the Regio Esercito loyal to our side have succeeded in their goal. The question now lies on what to do with primarily, the Red Guards. Some on the Left argue for the reorganisation of the Red Guards into a strict military to be utilised for National Defence, arguing for its experience and loyalty to the party.

On the other hand, members on the Right have voiced their opposition to this idea, citing the Red Guards as far too unorganised and disorderly to be trained into effective military forces responsibile for National Defence, instead opting to merely incorporate prominent paramilitary leaders into Army structure.

Foreign recognition of the Soviet Republic has been scarce, with recognition only coming from our socialist allies with the East. However, the establishemt of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will allow us to expand our international reach further and gain legitimacy as a nation around the world.

Similar to the Tsars of <span style="color: #bf0000">**Russia**</span>, Vittorio Emanuele III, in his fruitless and useless entry into the First World War has accumulated momumental debt, owed primarily to <span style="color: #00247D">**Bri**</span><span style="color: #CF142B">**tish**</span>, <span style="color: #39AAAA">**French**</span> and <span style="color: #3C3B6E">**Amer**</span><span style="color: #B22234">**ican**</span> debtors.

Though unfortunate, the financial stituation of the state is concerning, to say the least. As such, a motion to repudiate all debts owed from the Kingdom has been brought fourth, in an effort to the state remains fiscally stable in its infancy. Regardless, many on the right oppose the bill, calling it a 'death-blow' to <span style="color: #009246">**Italo**</span>-<span style="color: #046276">**Entente**</span> relations and the closing of trade or diplomatic opportunities with them.

In an effort to prevent subterfuge by the bourgeois elements remaining in the nation, Chairman [+ premier +] signs the 'Decree on the Suppression of Hostile Newspapers', outlawing the production and sale of newspapers calling for open resistance and disobedience towards the Soviet government. Reassurances are given that the bill is meant to be temporary, repealed following the restoration of stability.

[? if premier_party = "Bordigist" : The new decree, under influence of [+ premier +], has significantly broadened the definition of a 'hostile newspaper', as we have seen even some left-wing newspapers shut down, fuelled by accussations of factionalism and political disunity. ?]

[? if premier_party = "Turatian" : The new decree is seemingly less effective than expected, under influence of Chairman [+ premier +], the definition of a 'hostile newspaper' has been tightened significantly, as only fringe far-right and conservative newspapers are the main targets to be prosecuted. ?]

Religious principles have constrained the liberties of the opposite sex for too long, and though we cannot truly repay for the transgressions of our forebears, we will do as much as we can to burn away the stigmas of the past. No longer will women be trapped by the hands of the abuser or of the violator, as all deserve the protections to their own lives against those who would seek to harm them. Without resistance, the decree is signed, affirmed by the Congress of Soviets. Universally agreed upon within the party, we cannot let fear deprive our women from the tools to protect them from unwanted pregnancies.

Every citizen that lives within this new Italy must be granted true equality, not the twisted ideals that the Liberals and Popularists have built! They have toiled and yearned for freedom in the same manner as their male counterparts, and they too must be rewarded for their efforts. Finally, the right to vote has been grasped by the ladies of the revolution, as the decree is signed. Though our society might not be entirely ready, as misogyny still lives in the shadows, we must push towards the socialist dream of a truly free and fair society.

Why should a child be subjected to a life without education, toiling away for the sake of another human so they don’t have to work? This injustice must be remedied, and with our revolutionary state at the helm, it shall. Children will now be allowed to learn freely, unchained of the cycle that child labour perpetuates. No one votes against the eradication of this unsightly blemish on our society, and though the more business-minded individuals that remain may bawk at us, we will let the lack of their humanity be shown to the common man.

[? if signed_decrees == 0 : Our refusal to sign any decrees frustrates a not insignificant portion of the <span style="color: #BF0000">**Congress**</span>, seeing our actions as inaction in a time where it is desperately needed. ?]
