go-to: decisions

With a plurality of votes, Amadeo Bordiga is elected Chairman of the Committee, having garnered the votes of Bordigists and reluctant Ordinovists. The factional difference between the Secretary-General and Chairman is concerning.

Bordiga's ascension to power represents a significant ideological shift leftwards for the party, as well as harsher crackdowns on reactionaries and non-communists within the nation. Bordiga's divisive rhetoric against the Filippo Turati and his supporters do nothing to aid factional unity within the party, as well.

With a plurality of votes, Giacomo Menotti Serrati is elected Chairman of the Committee, having garnered the votes of Maximalists, Social Patriots and some of the more radical Unionists.

Serrati's ascension to power represents the continuation of the ideological balance between two opposing ends of the left-wing spectrum, excaberated by the success of the revolution. It is unclear whether Serrati will be able to keep the party in tact, or keep the Maximalists in charge to restore order.

With a plurality of votes, Filippo Turati is elected Chairman of the Committee, having garnered the votes of Turatians, Gradualists and the moderate Unionists. The factional difference between the Secretary-General and Chairman is concerning.

Turati's ascension to power represents a significant ideological shift towards the right, as it is likely Turati will seek to forge pragmatic alliances outside the party in an effort to stabilise the nation.

The *Statuto Albertino*, the constitution of the <span style="color: #009246">**Kingdom of Italy**</span> has been abolished. In it's place, naturally, suggestions for a new Constitution has been rampant. Though the current governmental structure derives from the Soviet Constitution, some on the left and right wings of the party suggest the drafting of a new constitution, arguing the conditions of revolution in <span style="color: #009246">**Italy**</span> are significantly different as compared to <span style="color: #bf0000">**Russia**</span>.

On the other hand, the Maximalists argue that merely slight iterations to a <span style="color: #bf0000">**Russian**</span>-inspired Constitution is necessary for a functional Constitution, and that the drafting of a new constituion would be pointless and only slow down efforts to stabilise the nation.

Following the end of the Civil War, the Red Guards, now fielding [+ rg_strength +] thousand men alongside forces within the Regio Esercito loyal to our side have succeeded in their goal. The question now lies on what to do with primarily, the Red Guards. Some on the Left argue for the reorganisation of the Red Guards into a strict military to be utilised for National Defence, arguing for its experience and loyalty to the party.

On the other hand, members on the Right have voiced their opposition to this idea, citing the Red Guards as far too unorganised and disorderly to be trained into effective military forces responsibile for National Defence, instead opting to incorporate prominent paramilitary leaders into Army structure.
