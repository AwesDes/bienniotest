= King rescinds support for the PNF 

Following the recent elections & the fascists' failure to consolidate power, King [+ king +] has rescinded his support for the PNF, denouncing [+ pnf_leader +] and the party for its ineffectiveness and failures to stabilise the country.

Already, we have seen a significant drop in support for the fascists, as voters return to less radical parties, alongside a drop in far-right paramilitary strength.

Fascism is dead, at least in Italy.

- @root: Thus falls the failed experiment.
