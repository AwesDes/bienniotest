= Formation of the Italian Liberal Party

The Italian Liberal Party has been formed. A merger of the parties under the Liberal List, a consolidated party for the liberals has been formed, alongside the Italian Democratic Liberal Party.

In fact, there has been strong support from both sides of the party to form a united party, in order to further consolidate the liberal vote in the face of the Socialists and Catholics.

As expected, the [+ ldr_name +] have merged with the [+ ul_name +], consolidating the liberal vote into one political party that will stand against the other parties in the Chamber of Deputies. The PLDI will continue to exist as a weakened, defunct party, as figures such as Francesco Saverio Nitti and Vittorio Emanuele Orlando refuse to join the PLI.

on-arrival: ul_congress_trigger = 1; ldr_leader = "Orlando" if ldr_leader == "Salandra"

Surprisingly, whether it is because of the poor relations, the PLDI's ideological differences with the [+ ul_name +] or something else, the [+ ldr_name +] have refused to merge with the [+ ul_name +], remaining as an independent party running its own electoral list.

In response, however, Antonio Salandra and his right-wing bloc have defected to the PLI, seeing the PLDI as a sinking ship. The PLI will hold its first Party Congress shortly.
