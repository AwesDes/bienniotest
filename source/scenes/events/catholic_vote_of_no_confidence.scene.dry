# Options: spend relations to reduce coalition_dissent, ask for kpd to abstain

= Vote of No Confidence

The Italian People's Party have called for a vote of no confidence against us, due to our various policies and disagreements. If this succeeds, there will be a new government formed.

@vonc_menu

- @try_assuage: Try to assuage our partners.
- @let_it_happen: Let the vote happen.

@try_assuage

How do we assuage our partners?

- @white_leagues: Agree to temporarily end contention of influence with the White Leagues.
- @resources: Use our resources to reduce dissent within the coalition.
- @support_psri: Could we get the PSRI to abstain?
- @let_it_happen: Never mind. Let the vote happen.
- @let_it_happen_elections: Never mind. Let the vote happen and call for snap elections.

Fine. We pull back the Red Guards from rural areas of contention with the catholic White Leagues, allowing the PPI to grab our voters to the dismay of the party. The rural Arditismo capitalises on our absence as well, recruiting more forces and 'campaigning'.

By transferring resources to our coalition partners, we can reduce their dissent against our policies. This is a crude, but effective solution.

Both party votes, alongside some defectors from the minor parties are enough for us to maintain control of the government. We owe a massive debt to the PSRI, which could lead to broader cooperation in the future, for better or for worse.
