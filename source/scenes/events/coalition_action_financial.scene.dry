= Finance Minister [+ finance_minister +] authorizes tax cuts for the rich

Finance Minister [+ finance_minister +] has authorised tax cuts for the rich in order to stimulate the economy. These cuts are unpopular amongst our voting bloc, seeing them as unfair and greedy.

- @pm_nothing: There is nothing we can do.

[? if psi_in_government : We attempt to convince the workers and veterans that this is necessary for economic stability. Regardless, support for the [+ finance_minister_party +] from workers and veterans decreases notably, and as do we for tolerating the cuts. The [+ pnf_name +] are able to use this policy to recruit more members. ?]

[? if not psi_in_government : The cuts pass, and we utilise them to recruit workers who have lost faith in the liberal parties, alongside the [+ pnf_name +]. ?]
