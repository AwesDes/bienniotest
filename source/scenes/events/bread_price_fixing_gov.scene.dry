= Price Control Measures

The [+ ul_full_name +] has floored a bill that would abolish price controls on essential goods, including a controversial abolishing of price controls on bread. Our support base, allies and the vast majority of our leadership has demanded we vote against the bill, as a general strike has seemingly begun once more in response to this.

What should we do?

- @vote_yes: Vote yes, abolishing the price controls on bread.
- @vote_no: Vote no, against abolishing the price controls on bread.
- @abstain: Abstain from the vote.

Our grassroots party members are shocked by our intransigence! Many party branches have begun agitating against the cabinet, and our own delegation members even plan a full vote on the proposal, contravening the government's decision.

The workers view this as betrayal, as do the unions. The bill is voted down anyways by a slight margin in fear of the ongoing general strike.

@vote_no
on-arrival: ul_relation -= 10; ldr_relation -= 5; communist_dissent -= 5; labour_dissent -= 5; workers_psi += 3*(1-dissent); coalition_dissent += 1;

Our coalition partners are angered by our defiance! Regardless of our vote, the bill is voted down a significant measure in fear of the ongoing general strike. The coalition government does not seem that it will last.
