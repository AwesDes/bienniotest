= [+ ds_name +] Fractures!

The [+ ds_name +] has always been a historically unstable party, having had members from left to right wings of the political sphere. However, these ideological differences have typically been placed in check by the party's leadership, notably Giovanni Antonio Colonna di Cesar√≤. However, the rise of the [+ ds_full_name +] as the dominant party in the liberal sphere has resulted in an worsening of these party internal politics, as arguments and fights between members break out regularly.

The party can no longer hold through compromise.

- @ds_collapse: The left, led by Giuffrida, and the right, led by Carnazza, split from the party.

!}

Both the 'Christian Social Party', led by Gabriello Carnazza and the 'Liberal Workers' Party', led by Vincenzo Giuffrida have been founded, as the remnants of the [+ ds_name +] have been left as the party becomes defunct, a shadow of its former self.
