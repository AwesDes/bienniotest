= Whispers of a Plot

Our sources have sent us concerning behaviour regarding the Fasci. They have been militarising further, as meetings between the fascists and the military have increased in frequency, with some even floating the rumor that the [+ pnf_leader +] is planning a coup.

How should we react to these claims?

- @expand_paramilitaries: Expand the Red Guards.
- @increase_relations: Improve our relation with our coalition allies and the King.
- @root: What's the worst that could happen?

@expand_paramilitaries
subtitle: An injection of funds would be useful in the event of anything.
unavailable-subtitle: [? if resources < 1 : Not enough resources. (Need 1) ?][? if revolutionary_fervour < 40 : The majority of the party refuses to act based on mere rumors. ?]
choose-if: resources > 0 and revolutionary_fervour > 39
on-arrival: resources -= 1; rg_strength += 20;

The expansion of the Red Guards is accepted by most of the factions as a necessity, especially seeing the violence occurring daily within Italy.

@increase_relations
subtitle: Stronger relations with our allies in government might help in the event of anything.
choose-if: participating = 1 and psi_in_government = 1 and resources > 0
unavailable-subtitle: [? if participating = 0 : We have already agreed to abandon parliamentary means. ?][? if not psi_in_government : We are not in government. ?][? if resources < 1 : Not enough resources. (Need 1) ?]

Relations between the coalition parties are strengthened and overtures are made to the King, [? if radicalisation < 6 :who responds warmly to our outreach. ?][? if radicalisation > 5 :who responds mildly to our outreach. ?]
