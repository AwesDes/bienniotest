= Food riots break out across Italy!

Food riots have broken out across Italy, mainly the north, regarding the extreme prices of food items following post-war inflation. What should we do?

- @expand_aid: Expand our welfare & food programs to aid the rioters.
- @solidarity_protest: Protest in solidarity with the rioters.
- @condemn_protest: Condemn the violent protestors.

@expand_aid 
subtitle: -1 Party Resource - We can take the opportunity to grow our popularity.
choose-if: resources > 0
unavailable-subtitle: Not enough party resources. (Need 1)
on-arrival: workers_psi += 3*(1-dissent); rural_psi += 4*(1-dissent); veterans_psi += 3*(1-dissent); resources -= 1; ds_left += 0.2

Our actions have earned us new supporters in our usual bases, thanking us for our aid.

@solidarity_protest
subtitle: Our actions will only exacerbate the situation.
on-arrival: workers_psi += 2*(1-dissent); rural_psi += 3*(1-dissent); middle_class_psi -= 2*(1-dissent); ldr_relation -= 3; ul_relation -= 5; ds_relation -= 3; radicalisation += 0.2;

We protest alongside the protestors and defending the common worker in the face of bourgeois greed, though our actions are seen less fondly by the governing coalition, seeing it as only exacerbating the situation further.

@condemn_protest
subtitle: Our voting base won't be happy about this.
on-arrival: workers_psi -= 1*(1-dissent); rural_psi -= 2*(1-dissent); middle_class_psi += 2*(1-dissent); communist_dissent += 10; maximalist_dissent += 10; labour_dissent += 10; syndicalist_dissent += 10 if syndicalist_active; reformist_dissent += 5; ldr_relation += 10; ul_relation += 5; ppi_relation += 10; radicalisation -= 0.5;

Our actions are criticised by every faction of the party. Though the ruling coalition certainly appreciates our attempt to quell the riots, it comes at a loss of our voters, who see this as a betrayal of the worker.
