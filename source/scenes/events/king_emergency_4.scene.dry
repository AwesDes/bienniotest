= New Elections Scheduled

King Vittorio Emanuele III has dissolved the sitting Chamber of Deputies in accordance with Article 9 and scheduled new elections set to occur in [+ next_election_month : month +] [+ next_election_year +], the longest allowed to be set. This comes at a time following a vicious crackdown by the King, and it is obvious the Cabinet is seeking to garner enough seats to turn the 'Emergency Cabinet' into a legitimate government.

On the other hand, if we are able to hold back and succeed in retaining enough of a plurality to prevent the formation of a government or force the parties into a coalition with us, the 'Emergency Cabinet' will be unable to sustain its legitimacy, even with the support of the King. 

- @root: We must prepare for the worst.
