= Formation of the Italian Democratic Liberal Party

The Liberals, Democrats and Radicals list, also known as Liberali, democratici e radicali, under Orlando and Nitti, has reorganised itself, alongside the remnants of the Radical Party, under a new party from its current state as an electoral list, known as the Italian Democratic Liberal Party. The party still represents its former ideals, though it seems there will be a new party congress soon to establish its leadership.
