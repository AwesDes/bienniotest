= Economic & Agrarian Parties endorse the [+ pnf_name +]

It seems the radicalisation of our policies has gravely concerned the minor Conservative parties, specifically the *Economic Party* and the *Agrarian Party*, who have both endorsed the [+ pnf_name +], calling upon their base to support the party and forming a joint list with the Fascists for the next elections.

Regardless, their endorsement has brought a fairly moderate amount of landowners, factory owners and farmers to the Fascist's side.
