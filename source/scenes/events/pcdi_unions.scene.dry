= PCd'I Consolidates support base 

Though the recent split of the Left faction to form the *Partito Comunista d'Italia* as a splinter party was originally considered to be moribund, our labour faction breaking with us as well has resulted in the syndicalist *Unione Sindacale Italiana* to defect to the party, as the PCd'I seems to have consolidated and become a competitor to our party.
