The vote succeeds, and our government has resigned. Prime Minister [+ prime_minister +] remains as the head of the government, but no longer has the power to enact new policies.

[? if next_election_time >= 4 : A new government will be formed within the scope of the current composition of the Chamber of Deputies. ?]
[? if next_election_time < 4 : A new government will be formed within the scope of the next composition of the Chamber of Deputies within the next 4 months. ?]
