= Reformist leaders defect

Our policy choices have greatly offended the reformist faction, seeing our turn towards radicalism. While some have joined the PSRI, the remainder have set up the Unitary Socialist Party.

Additionally and more importantly, a significant amount of our members in the Chamber of Deputies has defected to the PSU as well. [? if psi_in_government: They have maintained toleration of the current governing coalition. ?]
