= Paramilitary Policy

The beginning of our rule has not certainly been stable. Paramilitaries, such as the far-right *Fasci* [? if republican_terror : and the republican *Anti-Communist Brigade* ?] [? if communist_terror : and the communist *Red Guards* ?] have begun plaguing the nation, vowing to overthrow us. 

Naturally, however, we are not alone in the fight. The Carabinieri, alongside the Interior Ministry have been tasked with eliminating the paramilitary violence plaguing the streets and stabilisng the nation.

Current Budget allocated is [+ yearly_interior_gain +]. Current Budget remaining is [+ interior_budget +], which is replenished at the start of the year.

- @increase_budget: -1 Budget - Increase budget allocated to dealing with paramilitaries.
- @investigate_fascists: Investigate the far-right *Fasci*.
- @investigate_republican: Investigate the republican *Anti-Communist Brigades*
- @investigate_communist: Investigate the new communist *Red Guards*

@increase_budget
on-arrival: yearly_interior_gain += 1;

We increase the budget allocated dealing with the paramilitaries. This will be reflected in the next annual budget.
