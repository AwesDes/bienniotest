= Preparing the Revolution

Though our end goal is to achieve a soviet state like the Bolsheviks in Russia, actually going through with this plan will require extensive planning, from securing allies to weaponry.

- @rev_weapons: Infiltrate and secure weaponry for the Red Guards.
- @rev_loyalty: Infiltrate and secure loyalties of government forces.
- @rev_sabotage: Infiltrate and sabotage the reactionaries.
- @rev_finish: Finish up the last of the plans.
- @rev_begin: Mobilise the Red Guards and the workers!
- @root: Do nothing for now.
- @easy_discard
- @cancel_advisor_action

We continue arming the Red Guards, turning them into a true fighting force.

Via some...unconventional means, we are able to sway some of the Regio Esercito and Carabinieri to our side.

Through some carefully placed information and contacts, the Carabinieri 'discover' far-right paramilitary bases, raiding them and arresting their forces.

Our preparations seem to have borne fruit, as it seems will be have an advantage if we ever have to utilise our preparations in the near future.
